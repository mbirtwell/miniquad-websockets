Miniquad Websockets
===================

A plugin for [miniquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad) that adds support for websockets.
Requires [my fork of miniquad](https://github.com/mbirtwell/miniquad) which adds support for
injecting custom events to the miniquad event loop. That modification of miniquad currently 
only works on windows and wasm.
